# React Book App

I created an book app site. In the design, I implemented the dynamics with REACT.<br>

I created the visual sections, which are also seen in the design, with Bootsrap. I prepared the dynamics separately for the states.
First, we add our book by entering the book name. Afterwards, I prepared buttons where we can change the reading status, edit the name of the book and remove the book.
